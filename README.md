# Project acme-web-design

This project is about creating a website with using only plain HTML & CSS.

I learn a lot of new things that;

* Splitting projects to small parts.

* Creating new branch from master then merge them.

* Making a responsive layout website with its requirements.

  * Using width attributes with % value.

  * Max and Min width value. 

* Creating random paragraphs with https://www.lipsum.com/.

* Using media CSS styles for responsive layout.

 I get more comfortable in pushing and pulling changes.

 I learned how to write user stories.

 I had no struggles.
